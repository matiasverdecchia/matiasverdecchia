abstract: "In this squib, I evaluate the contradiction analysis (Abrusán in
  Natural Language Semantics 19(3):257–321, 2011, in Weak island semantics,
  2014) and the necessary infelicity analysis (Oshima in Washio et al. (eds.),
  New frontiers in artificial intelligence, 2007; Schwarz and Simonenko in
  Natural Language Semantics 26(3–4):253–279, 2018b) of factive islands in light
  of a pattern that has not been previously discussed in the literature:
  questions about propositions. I argue that while the necessary infelicity
  approach can straightforwardly explain the acceptability of this kind of
  question, the contradiction account undergenerates, since it wrongly predicts
  their ungrammaticality. I claim that this prediction follows from the
  assumption that the domain of quantification contains contraries. Therefore,
  the main contribution of this squib is the observation that such an assumption
  cannot play an explanatory role in accounting for factive islands."
