abstract: "In this paper I analyze the distribution of the reflexive construction _se_ + _a sí mismo_ in Romance (e.g., ‘Juan se peinó a sí mismo’). I propose that these structures are transitive. Concretely, I argue that in these cases the reflexive anaphor is the internal argument of the predicate, and that the obligatory presence of the clitic _se_ is due to the general phenomenon of clitic doubling with pronominal objects. I show that this approach can account for some asymmetries between these constructions and simple se-reflexives regarding expletive insertion in French, _proxy_ readings, comparative constructions, association with focus, and case distribution in causatives."
